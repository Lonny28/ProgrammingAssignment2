## This is programming assignment 2, where I will attempt to write
## two functions.  The first will Cache the mean of a vector,
## the second will cache the inverse of the matrix from the first function.

## Here is the first function, called makeCacheMatrix
## I'll add more comments later as it grows

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## The second function cache solve follows.
## I'll add more code as I go

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
